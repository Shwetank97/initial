# Initial
This project contains bookstore database management. It can be used to manage the working of the inflow and the sale of books and other items
from the store. The application can also be used to get various details related to different titles. It uses JDBC database connectivity to 
create a link between the backend of SQL and the front end of java form. The whole process makes it easier for the user to eneter the data 
and also to retrieve it without getting lost in the whole pile of it.
